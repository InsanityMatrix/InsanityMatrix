Self-taught programmer since 8th grade, some of my favorite projects are SocialFoot, a fully functional social media with interactive games, encrypted messaging and posting. WorkoutCreator, an app that while not very pretty, is very technical and can create and log workouts for you based on preferences, and provide up to date research.

My current project is NetworkDiscoveryTool a windows application written in golang which allows you to see all the devices on a network, monitor their network traffic, ARP Spoof them, and block them from sending or recieving data from outside of the LAN.
