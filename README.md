- 👋 Hi, I’m @InsanityMatrix
- 👀 I’m interested in CyberSecurity, Full Stack Development, programming apps and websites.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning dart, cybersecurity, and UI Design.

- 📫 You can reach me through the email: InsanityMatrix@gmail.com

Self-taught programmer since 8th grade, some of my favorite projects are SocialFoot, a fully functional social media with interactive games, encrypted messaging and posting. WorkoutCreator, an app that while not very pretty, is very technical and can create and log workouts for you based on preferences, and provide up to date research.

My current project is LifeManager, an app that incorporates WorkoutCreator, is prettier, and also helps manage budgeting, other financial services, and can track your assets.
